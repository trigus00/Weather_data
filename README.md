### -- Project Status : Completed 

## Project Intro/Objective 
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
### Methods Used 
* Data Visualization
* Statistics
* Predictive Modeling
### Technologies Used 
* Python 
* Junpyter Notebook
* OpenWeatherMap API 

## Project Description 
The Purpose of this project is to creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API.


## Needs of this project
